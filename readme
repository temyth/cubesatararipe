Hi everyone! This is our repository for the OBSAT (CubeSat olympics in Brazil) and we expect to share our project details and give an opportunity to the community to help us in the project and also get acess to all the data collected
What is an cubesat? A cubesat is an mini satelitte in the format of an cube of normally 10cmÂ³. The idea of an CubeSat is to transmit telemetry data like temperature, pressure, gas sensors, and others. Images and videos are also type of data collected by an cubesat. CubeSats can also be used for communication purposes, like transpoders.
Why make an cubesat? Well, an cubesat is generally the best option for low cost missions, since it's an small and light satellite it can be launched in a small rocket, also with small costs.
